XReturnable
===========

This behavior can create URLs that allow to return to a page by storing its GET Parameters on a stack.

## Installation
* Extract the release file under `protected/extensions`
* Attach the beahvior in the [CController::init()] method of any controller you want to use it.

## Usage
Create an URL that contains all the GET parameter of the current page:

```php
<?php
echo CHtml::link('A link',
    $this->createReturnableUrl('user/edit',array('id'=>124))
);
```

If you perform an action on the page `user/edit` you can use this code to return to the originating page:

```php
<?php
$this->goBack()
```
~~~

or create a link to the originating page in the `view` with:

```php
<?php echo CHtml::link('Cancel',$this->getReturnUrl()) ?>
```
~~~

See the included demo for a more extensive example.
